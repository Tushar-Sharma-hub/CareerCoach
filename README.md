# CareerCoach

AI-powered interview preparation and career readiness platform for freshers.

## 1. Project Name

CareerCoach

## 2. Problem Statement

Fresh graduates often struggle to convert theoretical knowledge into interview-ready skills. They face multiple challenges at the same time:

- Lack of realistic mock interviews tailored to their target role
- Unclear understanding of how recruiters evaluate resumes and technical answers
- Weak feedback loops after practice interviews
- No personalized roadmap to improve skills for a specific job profile or salary target
- Limited access to affordable, structured interview coaching and career guidance

Most existing tools are either generic, expensive, or not tailored to Indian fresher hiring patterns. There is a clear gap between classroom learning and actual hiring expectations.

## 3. Project Overview

CareerCoach is a multi-agent AI platform designed to help freshers prepare for jobs by combining resume intelligence, role-based mock interviews, real-time scoring, and personalized learning roadmaps. The system aims to give users a guided career prep workflow that feels like a personal interview coach, technical mentor, and roadmap planner in one place.

The project focuses on creating a practical AI-assisted ecosystem for job preparation rather than a static chatbot. It combines multiple AI-driven services to analyze resume quality, simulate interviews, evaluate responses, and recommend a clear path toward role-specific improvement.

## 4. Proposed Solution

CareerCoach introduces an AI-powered preparation stack that helps users:

- Upload and analyze resumes using AI-based extraction and evaluation
- Choose interview types such as HR and technical interviews
- Practice interviews with dynamic AI-generated questions
- Receive evaluation, feedback, and summary reports after every answer
- Track performance through dashboards and interview history
- Generate personalized learning roadmaps based on role and target package

Instead of a single generic assistant, the platform uses specialized AI agents to handle different stages of the journey: resume analysis, interview question generation, feedback generation, and roadmap planning.

## 5. Objectives

The project aims to achieve the following goals:

1. Help freshers practice realistic interviews for common job roles.
2. Provide actionable feedback instead of generic answers.
3. Convert resume data into structured skill and gap analysis.
4. Generate a role-specific learning roadmap aligned with salary goals.
5. Reduce the gap between self-preparation and recruiter expectations.
6. Build a scalable AI-assisted career platform that can be extended to broader recruitment and upskilling use cases.

## 6. Target Users / Use Case

### Primary Target Users

- College students preparing for campus placements
- Fresh graduates applying for software roles
- Career switchers entering tech-related job markets
- Students needing structured interview preparation and role guidance

### Use Cases

- A fresher wants to practice a technical interview for a backend engineer role.
- A student uploads a resume and wants AI to identify missing skills and weak sections.
- A user wants a roadmap to reach a target package such as 20 LPA or 30 LPA.
- A candidate wants detailed feedback after answering interview questions.

## 7. Open-Source AI Technology Selected

The project uses the following open-source AI ecosystem and supporting technologies:

- openai/gpt-oss-120b (open-weight reasoning model used for interview coaching, evaluation, and roadmap generation)
- LangChain for prompting and LLM orchestration
- LangGraph for multi-step agent workflows and graph-based execution
- Redis for fast caching and session optimization
- MongoDB for storing interview records, resumes, and learning progress
- Firebase Authentication for login and user state management

This combination allows the project to build a real AI agent-based interview system with meaningful orchestration, not just a basic API wrapper.

## 8. Why This Technology Was Selected

### openai/gpt-oss-120b

This model was selected because it is strong at reasoning, instruction following, and structured output generation, which is critical for:

- generating role-specific interview questions
- evaluating answers with feedback
- creating summary reports and recommendations
- generating a tailored learning roadmap

### LangChain + LangGraph

These frameworks were chosen to model the application as a workflow-driven system:

- interview initiation
- answer evaluation
- completion detection
- summary generation
- roadmap generation

This makes the system modular, explainable, and easier to scale with more agents or tools later.

### Redis and MongoDB

These database and cache layers are necessary for performance and persistence:

- Redis caches recent user data and reduces repeated queries
- MongoDB stores structured records such as resume metadata, interview history, and roadmap results

## 9. AI's Role in the System

AI is not a decorative feature in this project; it acts as the decision engine across the full user journey.

AI responsibilities include:

- Parsing resume content and identifying strengths, missing skills, and ATS gaps
- Generating well-structured role-specific interview questions
- Evaluating candidate responses against expected quality, clarity, and technical depth
- Producing performance summaries and improvement suggestions
- Personalizing a career roadmap based on role, package target, and resume data

The AI system is designed to behave like a coach rather than a generic chatbot, making it more useful and credible for actual hiring preparation.

## 13. Agentic Workflow (if applicable)

The project follows a multi-agent workflow pattern where each AI agent is responsible for a dedicated part of the journey.

### Interview Workflow

1. User selects interview type and role.
2. Interview service triggers the interview agent.
3. AI generates a list of relevant questions.
4. User answers each question one by one.
5. Feedback agent evaluates the answer.
6. If the interview is complete, summary agent creates a final performance report.
7. Results are stored for dashboard analytics and future review.

### Roadmap Workflow

1. User enters target role and package goal.
2. Roadmap service uses role context and optional resume context.
3. AI generates a plan covering learning priorities, milestones, and next steps.
4. The system stores the roadmap and shows it in a structured format.
